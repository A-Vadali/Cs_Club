# What's git?

![xkcd](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a tool programmers use to keep track of their files. It stores different versions of a file in a series of checkpoints. Git allows you to revert back to any checkpoint and work on your files from there. Let's say I am storing an essay I'm working on in git. When I write the first draft of my essay on why empirically the Corgi is the cutest dog, I put it into a git checkpoint. I then decide I want to write about the history of the [Queen's dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth%27s_corgis), so I rework the essay from this angle and save it an another checkpoint. Once I get tired of reading about the antics of the royal family,["Royal Clock-winder, Leonard Hubbard, was bitten by Susan (the Corgi) upon entering the nursery at the Royal Lodge, Windsor"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth%27s_corgis), I decide that I liked my first essay better. With git, I can revert back to my first checkpoint and continue my master thesis on Corgis. If I decide to, I can save my work in a checkpoint and go back to work on the history of the queen's dog. This is what "Graph theory tree model" means. You can branch off of any checkpoint you want and work from there. Below is a graphic to help you visualize this branching.

# It's collaborative 

You can use git to work on projects with [others](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-collaborate-on-github--net-34267). It's like Google Doc for developers. Git is used by most open source projects such as, [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) a [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) library, [open CV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) a computer [vision](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-undergraduate-OpenCV-projects-What-are-some-practical-accessible-topics-in-real-time-computer-vision-Also-what-is-the-learning-curve-for-OpenCV-and-or-its-interfaces-with-Python-MATLAB) library, and [atom](https://github.com/atom/atom) a text editor.

# Getting started
[Github](https://github.com/) is a website that offers free git services. Github runs a git server which you can use to work on your projects. However, you don't have to use github to use git, you can run your [own git server](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-on-the-Server). I'll walk you through using git with github. Sign up for a github account. Then hit the green new repository button. Name the repository whatever you want. Git clone the repository in terminal. If you haven't already you'll need to install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Now change something in this repo (Note that you'll have to change directory into the github repo, see [here](http://latincsclub.com/2017-08-19/commmand-line) for more info). This command creates a file called README.md.

    echo "Hello" > README.md
	
To see what has changed type `git status`. 
	
	Chriss-MacBook-Air:ASAR chris$ git status
    On branch master

    Initial commit

    Untracked files:
       (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	README.md

    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
    Chriss-MacBook-Air:ASAR chris$ 

It's pretty verbose, to add README.md to the repo type.

    Chriss-MacBook-Air:ASAR chris$ git add README.md 

You can now see that it has been added.

    Chriss-MacBook-Air:ASAR chris$ git status
    On branch master

    Initial commit

    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   README.md

    Chriss-MacBook-Air:ASAR chris$ 

To create a checkpoint you need to commit it. Every checkpoint has a message attached to it.

    Chriss-MacBook-Air:ASAR chris$ git commit -m "first edit"
    [master (root-commit) 2ece2ee] first edit
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
    create mode 100644 README.md
    Chriss-MacBook-Air:ASAR chris$ 

You should put your message in between the quotes. It's good to make it descriptive, so when you go back you know what has changed.
To sync it with github, you need to push it.

    Chriss-MacBook-Air:ASAR chris$ git push
    Counting objects: 3, done.
    Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 217 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
    Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    To github.com:Chrisr850/ASAR.git
     * [new branch]      master -> master
    Chriss-MacBook-Air:ASAR chris$ 


Now your repo is synced with github, and you will be able to see it on github. The basic work-flow is to check what's changed with `git status` then add the file with `git add <file>` and then commit it with `git commit -m "message"` and then push it with `git push`. Git has [many](https://git-scm.com/docs) commands and features, in fact we even use git to host this site, but for normal day to day use you only need to know these four commands. Git is a useful tool to know how to use because it let's you work with your files without ever losing anything. I also recommend [enabling ssh](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/) for git so that you don't need to type your username and password every time you push to github.
