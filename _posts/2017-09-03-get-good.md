# What's git?

![xkcd](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a tool programmers use to keep track their files. It stores different versions of a file as it changes. It also to revert back to any version and work from there. Let's say I was writing an essay using git. I could write a first draft on why empirically the corgi is the cutest dog. I then put it into a git checkpoint. But then I decide I want to pivot to the history of the [Queen's dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth%27s_corgis). I then I make another git checkpoint. Once I get tired of reading gems like ["Royal Clock-winder, Leonard Hubbard, was bitten by Susan (the corgi) upon entering the nursery at the Royal Lodge, Windsor."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth%27s_corgis). I decide at this point I liked my first essay better. I can then revert back to my first checkpoint and continue my argument about corgis. I can revert to any checkpoint at any point and continue this what "Graph theory tree model" means.

# It's collaborative 

You can use git to work on projects with [others](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-collaborate-on-github--net-34267). It's like Google docs for developers. Git is used by most open source projects such as, [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) a [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) library, [open CV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) a computer [vision](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-undergraduate-OpenCV-projects-What-are-some-practical-accessible-topics-in-real-time-computer-vision-Also-what-is-the-learning-curve-for-OpenCV-and-or-its-interfaces-with-Python-MATLAB) library, and [atom](https://github.com/atom/atom) a text editor.

# Getting started
[Github](https://github.com/) is a website that offers free git services. Github run's a git server with which you can use to work on your projects. However, you don't have to use github to use git you can run your [own git server](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-on-the-Server). I'll walk you through the process of using git. Sign up for a github account. Then hit the green new respitory button. Name the repository whatever you want. Git clone the repository in terminal.

Now change something. This command creates a file called README.md.

    echo "Hello" > README.md
	
Type git status. 
	
	Chriss-MacBook-Air:ASAR chris$ git status
    On branch master

    Initial commit

    Untracked files:
       (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	README.md

    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
    Chriss-MacBook-Air:ASAR chris$ 

It's pretty self explantory to add the README.md to the repo type.

    Chriss-MacBook-Air:ASAR chris$ git add README.md 

You can now see that it has been added.

    Chriss-MacBook-Air:ASAR chris$ git status
    On branch master

    Initial commit

    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   README.md

    Chriss-MacBook-Air:ASAR chris$ 

Now to create a checkpoint you need to commit it.

    Chriss-MacBook-Air:ASAR chris$ git commit -m "first edit"
    [master (root-commit) 2ece2ee] first edit
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
    create mode 100644 README.md
    Chriss-MacBook-Air:ASAR chris$ 

You can put anything you want between the quotes. It's good to make it describive so when you go back you know what has changed.
To sync it with github you need to push it.

    Chriss-MacBook-Air:ASAR chris$ git push
    Counting objects: 3, done.
    Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 217 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
    Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
    To github.com:Chrisr850/ASAR.git
     * [new branch]      master -> master
    Chriss-MacBook-Air:ASAR chris$ 


Now your repo is synced with github, and will be able to see it on github. The basic workflow is to check what's changed with `git status` then add the filer with `git add <file>` and then commit it with `git commit -m "message"` then push it with `git push`. Git has [many](https://git-scm.com/docs) commands and features, in fact we even use git to host this site, but for normal day to day use you only need to use know these four commands.
