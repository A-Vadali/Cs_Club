# What's git?

![xkcd](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a tool programmers use to keep track their files. It stores different versions of a file as it changes. It also to revert back to any version and work from there. Let's say I was writing an essay using git. I could write a first draft on why empirically the corgi is the cutest dog. I then put it into a git checkpoint. But then I decide I want to pivot to the history of the [Queen's dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth%27s_corgis). I then I make another git checkpoint. Once I get tired of reading gems like ["Royal Clock-winder, Leonard Hubbard, was bitten by Susan (the corgi) upon entering the nursery at the Royal Lodge, Windsor."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth%27s_corgis). I decide at this point I liked my first essay better. I can then revert back to my first checkpoint and continue my argument about corgis. I can revert to any checkpoint at any point and continue this what "Graph theory tree model" means.

# It's collaborative 

You can use git to work on projects with [others](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-collaborate-on-github--net-34267). It's like Google docs for developers. Git is used by most open source projects such as, [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) a [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) library, [open CV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) a computer [vision](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-undergraduate-OpenCV-projects-What-are-some-practical-accessible-topics-in-real-time-computer-vision-Also-what-is-the-learning-curve-for-OpenCV-and-or-its-interfaces-with-Python-MATLAB) library, and [atom](https://github.com/atom/atom) a text editor.

# Getting started

[Github](https://github.com/) is a website that offers free git services. Github run's a git server with which you can use to work on your projects. However, you don't have to use github to use git you can run your [own git server](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-on-the-Server). I'll walk you through the process of using git.
