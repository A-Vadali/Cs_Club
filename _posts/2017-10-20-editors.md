# How do I use Emacs?

## Getting Started

You can use emacs right of the box. You can download a copy from GNU. Out of the box it won't look great. The first thing you'll have to do is install melpa. Melpa is package manager that lets you install a lots of different packages. It's has a mode for pretty much any programming which let's you have things like text highlighting for any language you want. 

## Using emacs

The basics you need to use is alt-x. Let's you exec command. Cmd-x Cmd-f to open
a file. Save is Cmd-x Cmd-s. This means press command and x and then command and
s. Be sure to save early and often.
