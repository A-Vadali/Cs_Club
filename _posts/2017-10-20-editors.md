## Your choice of editor

A developer's choice of editor is a personal decision. Choosing an editor is like choosing a fashion style, it's liable to change in the future. People in the developer community can be very [opinionated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war) about your choice of editor, but at the end of the day use what makes sense to you. I use Emacs because it works well for me.

## Emacs history

GNU Emacs was first developed by [Richard Stallman](https://stallman.org/). Stallman has developed a [cult](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIF5xnkcncI) like following in the open source community. The Emacs family of editors has been [around](https://www.jwz.org/doc/emacs-timeline.html) for a [while](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsHistory). Emacs is a program that lets you edit text, but it does so much more. Emacs is written in and runs its own version of [lisp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/index.html); This has led to the joke that Emacs is [great operating system](http://wiki.c2.com/?EmacsAsOperatingSystem). With Emacs, you can check your calendar, browse the web, and even write emails. The reason for all of this functionality is that [you can be easily extend it using that lisp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eintr.html). 

## Getting Started

![emacs](http://latincsclub.com/assets/editors/emacs0.png)
Out of the box, Emacs won't look very pretty. You can download a copy from [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). The first thing I like to do is to disable the menu, tool and scroll bars. You can do this by opening a file called .emacs. Press C-x C-f, C means to press control, so you would hit Control x and then Control f, you should see a menu bar at the bottom. Type .emacs into it and hit enter. A new buffer should appear that is empty. Copy and paste the following lines into the file.

    (menu-bar-mode -1) 
    (toggle-scroll-bar -1) 
    (tool-bar-mode -1) 

Then press C-x C-s to save it. Now close Emacs and reopen it, you'll notice that Emacs now looks more streamlined.

To install a theme, you'll need to install Melpa. Melpa is package
manager that lets you install lots of different Emacs packages. Insert this into your .emacs. 

    (require 'package)
    (setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
    (add-to-list 'package-archives
         '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))

    (package-initialize)

    ;; Bootstrap `use-package'
    (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-refresh-contents)
    (package-install 'use-package))

    (use-package cyberpunk-theme
     :ensure t)

Now open and close Emacs. You should now see. The code above is taken from [c'est la z](http://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs/) a more in depth tutorial on Emacs.

We've now installed the cyberpunk theme. If you want to load another theme just change cyberpunk-theme with another theme. [Here's](https://emacsthemes.com/) a list of things.

# Spacemacs

Spacemacs is an Emacs distribution that comes with a lot of packages preinstalled. To install it you will need [Git](http://latincsclub.com/2017-09-03/get-good).
