# Alonzo Church and Alan Turing

Alonzo Church was a famous mathematician. He worked with Alan Turing on the Entscheidungsproblem. The Entscheidungsproblem is the idea of whether a program will halt or not. Turing developed his famous turing machines to help solve this problem. Turing machines are computers that operate on an infinite tape of ones and zeros. Turing Machines were necessary because it allowed Turing to express computation in a mathematical sense. Church developed another way of expressing computation called lambda calculus.

# Lambda Calculus

Lamba expressions are way to represent functions.

    λx.x

    f(x) = x

The two expressions above are equivelant. They both return there input. This what's called an identity function. To evaluate a lamba expression you replace the variable with what is being evaluated for.

    λx.x
    1 (λx.x)
    1

Here 1 replaces x. 

    λx.λy.y

The above function has two inputs. 

    λx.λy.y

    1 2 (λx.λy.y)
    1 (λy.y)
    1
    
    3 4 (λx.λy.y)
    3 (λy.y)
    3

As you can see this function drops it's first argument.
