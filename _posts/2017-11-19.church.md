# Alonzo Church and Alan Turing

Alonzo Church was a famous mathematician. He worked with Alan Turing on the Entscheidungsproblem. The Entscheidungsproblem is the idea of whether a program will halt or not. Turing developed his famous turing machines. Turing machines are computers that operate on an infinite tape of ones and zeros. Turing Machines were necessary because it allowed Turing to express computation in a mathematical sense. Church developed another way of expressing computation called lambda calculus.
