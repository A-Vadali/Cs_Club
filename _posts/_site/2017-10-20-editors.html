<h2 id="your-choice-of-editor">Your choice of editor</h2>

<p>A developer’s choice of editor is a personal decision. An editor is like fashion style; it is liable to change. People in the developer community can be very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">opinionated</a> about your choice of editor, but at the end of the day use what makes sense to you. I use Emacs because it works well for me.</p>

<h2 id="emacs-history">Emacs history</h2>

<p>GNU Emacs was first developed by <a href="https://stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a>. Stallman has developed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIF5xnkcncI">cult</a> like following in the open source community, because of his development of Emacs and other projects. The Emacs family of editors has been <a href="https://www.jwz.org/doc/emacs-timeline.html">around</a> for a <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsHistory">while</a>. Emacs is a program that lets you edit text, but it does much more. Emacs is written in and runs its own version of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/index.html">lisp</a>. Every time you type or execute a command in emacs your really just running lisp code. This has led to the joke that Emacs is <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?EmacsAsOperatingSystem">great operating system</a>. With Emacs, you can check your calendar, browse the web, and even write emails. The reason for all of this functionality is that <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eintr.html">you can be easily extend it using Emac’s lisp</a>.</p>

Out of the box, Emacs won’t look very pretty. You can download a copy from <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU</a>. The first thing I like to do is to disable the menu, tool and scroll bars. You can do this by opening a file called .emacs. Press C-x C-f ( C means to press control so you would hit Control x and then Control f) you should see a menu bar at the bottom. Type .emacs into it and hit enter. A new buffer should appear that is empty. Copy and paste the following lines into the file.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(menu-bar-mode -1) 
(toggle-scroll-bar -1) 
(tool-bar-mode -1) 
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Then press C-x C-s to save it. Now close Emacs and reopen it, you’ll notice that Emacs now looks more streamlined.</p>

<p>To install a theme, you’ll need to install Melpa. Melpa is package
manager that lets you install lots of different Emacs packages. A package manager is something that let’s you easily install others peoples programs.  Insert the following into your .emacs. To set up Melpa.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>(require 'package)
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
     '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))

(package-initialize)

;; Bootstrap `use-package'
(unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
(package-refresh-contents)
(package-install 'use-package))

(use-package cyberpunk-theme
 :ensure t)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The code above is taken from <a href="http://cestlaz.github.io/stories/emacs/">c’est la z</a>, a great in depth tutorial on Emacs. When you open and close emacs you’ll see the theme.</p>

<p><img src="http://latincsclub.com/assets/editors/emacs2.png" alt="emacs" /></p>

<p>If you want to load another theme just change <code class="highlighter-rouge">cyberpunk-theme</code> to another theme. <a href="https://emacsthemes.com/">Here’s</a> a list of themes.</p>

<h1 id="spacemacs">Spacemacs</h1>

<p><a href="http://spacemacs.org/">Spacemacs</a> is an Emacs distribution that comes with a lot of packages preinstalled. To install it you will need <a href="http://latincsclub.com/2017-09-03/get-good">Git</a>. It looks nice but I’ve found it to be too slow for my taste.</p>
